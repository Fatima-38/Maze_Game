This project is a Python-based Maze Solver that reads a maze from a text file and finds a path from start to goal. ðŸ§©It uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore possible routes through the maze efficiently.The program visually represents the maze and the solution path in both the console and as an image output. ðŸ§ It demonstrates concepts of graph traversal, backtracking, and state exploration.
Perfect for understanding how search algorithms work in problem-solving and pathfinding applications. ðŸš€
