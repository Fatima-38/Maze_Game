ðŸ§© Maze Game Description

This Python program is a Maze Game that reads a maze layout from a text file (maze.txt). In the maze, the letter A marks the start point, B marks the goal, â–ˆ (or # or any other non-space character) represents walls, and spaces represent open paths. The program uses a frontier-based search algorithm to explore possible routes from the start to the goal. By default, it employs Depth-First Search (DFS) through the StackFrontier class, but it can easily be switched to Breadth-First Search (BFS) by using the QueueFrontier class instead. This allows users to visualize and compare different pathfinding strategies within the same maze framework.ðŸ’¡ðŸ§
