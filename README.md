ðŸ“˜ ðŸ§©Maze Game Description

The program reads a maze from a text file (maze.txt), where:

A represents the start point
B represents the goal point

â–ˆ (or # / any other non-space character) represents walls

Spaces ( ) represent paths

It then uses a frontier-based search algorithm to explore possible paths and find a valid solution.
By default, it uses Depth-First Search (DFS) through the StackFrontier class, but you can switch to QueueFrontier for Breadth-First Search (BFS).
